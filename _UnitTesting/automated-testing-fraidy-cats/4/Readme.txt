Code Samples used in the
Automated Testing for Fraidy Cats Like Me
by Julie Lerman

Requires Visual Studio 2012

There are four solutions.

1) BEFORE for the Test First example
2) AFTER for the Test First example
3) BEFORE for the TDD example
4) AFTER for the TDD example

Note that in the video, I used the paid version of Telerik JustMock in the TDD example.
But for this download I have included the free version. Because the free version does not 
allow mocking of the DbSet (used in the tests related to cancelling an order), I had to modify 
the code to accommodate a different setup.

I have commented out the code the requires that version and replaced it with code
that can work with the free version that is being used in the download.
