C# Equality and Comparisons 
by Simon Robinson

All code has been created in VS2010 and tested in VS2010 and VS2013.
EqualButtons: Demonstrates that == evaluates reference equality for buttons
EqualStrings: Demonstrates that == evaluates value equality for strings
EqualInts: Demonstrates that == evaluates value equality for ints, but casting can change this to reference equality
EqualFloats: Demonstrates that apparently unequal floats can evaluate as equal.
FloatArithmetic: Demonstrates that floating point arithmetic can lead to 'wrong' answers for equality
