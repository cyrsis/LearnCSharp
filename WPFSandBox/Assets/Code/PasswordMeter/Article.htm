	<h2>Password Strength with Control</h2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

I am currently working on a number of small applications for personal use, all of which require a password to keep the data and application more secure. To ensure that I can only enter a strong password, I decided to create a password strength control which would display how strong the password is - like you get when signing up with lots of web sites - where they say Weak, Good, Strong or Very Strong. To this end I looked on the Internet for any code, and I could not find much.
