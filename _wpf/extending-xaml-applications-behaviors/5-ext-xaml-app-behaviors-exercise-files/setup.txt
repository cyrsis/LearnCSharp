To run the demos in this module, you will need to create the Zza database in your default instance of SQL Server on the same machine you are running on. Open the ZzaDatabaseGen.sql in SQL Management Studio, create a database named Zza, and execute the script to set up the schema and data in that database. If you are not using a local machine default instance, you will need to change the connection string in the app.config file of the project.
