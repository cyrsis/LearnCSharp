To build and run the demos from this module, you need to run the SQL script ZzaDatabaseGen.sql 
to create the Zza database in your default SQL Server instance. If you have a named SQL 
instance (i.e. SQLEXPRESS created by a Visual Studio installation) instead of a default instance,
you will need to modify the connection strings in the config file to reflect that.

Then you can simply build and run.
