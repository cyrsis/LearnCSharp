WPF Message Box
-----------------------------------
The idea behind this Message Box is to add styling to a MessageBox dialog.

The normal .NET MessageBox.Show() method uses a Win32 dialog that can't be styled to match your WPF application.

The message box user control contained in this sample can be styled.

NOTE: To use this PDSA Message Box you must include the Resource Dictionary file 'PDSAMessageBoxStyles.xaml' in your project 
You can reference this Resource Dictionary from your App.Xaml.
You also need a reference to the PDSAButtonStyles.xaml resource dictionary too.
